# smartrollerblind
App for Android to controll roller blind remotely.

All project was created based on a microcontroller managing its movement through a stepper motor. The control is done from within the application that allows to choose between two modes. Communication
between the application and the microcontroller takes place with the use of a real-time database. With its help, it is possible to control the application outside the place where the window is placed.
This repo shows app using Xamarin.Form framework. I used also Xamarin.Essential and FireBaseDatabase.Net library mainly.
